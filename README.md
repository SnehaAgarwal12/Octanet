ATM Machine Project in Python
I built an ATM machine simulation in Python. It includes features like user login, checking balances, making deposits and withdrawals, and viewing transaction history. This project highlights my skills in Python programming and creating user-friendly applications.
I developed an ATM machine simulation in Python, which includes key functionalities such as user authentication, balance inquiries, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history tracking. This project is a testament to my ability to create practical and user-friendly applications using Python.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system to manage multiple user accounts.
Balance Inquiry: Allows users to check their account balance.
Deposits and Withdrawals: Enables users to deposit and withdraw money, updating their balance accordingly.
Transaction History: Tracks and displays all transactions for user reference.
Libraries Used:
SQLite: For managing and storing user data and transaction history.
tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
hashlib: For securing passwords using hashing.
